  <h1>Understanding Change Management Roles</h1>
  <p>The CMII, Simple Change Management, and Express Change Management processes are available in the Product Engineering application. Each change process has its own Change Management ItemTypes and Workflows.  Each Change Management ItemType is handled by the following roles in its workflow:</p>
  <ul class="Disc">
    <li>Change Management (CM) Identities are used in the CMII and Simple Change Management Workflows.</li>
    <li>CM teams and CM identities are both used in Express Change Management workflows.</li>
    <li>System identities are roles that the system defines, such as an Item Creator or Owner.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As Administrator, you assign User and Group identities to the CM identities and teams used in your workflows.</p>
  <p class="Warning_paragraph">Each required role must be populated with the necessary identities before a Change Management workflow process starts.</p>
  <h2>Change Management Identities</h2>
  <p>Aras Product Engineering has built-in Group Identities that hold specific permissions such as control workflows associated with specific items, item creation, and item access. The following identities and roles are based on CMII standards.</p>
  <ol class="RoundSquare">
    <li>The Configuration Management (CM) group consists of CSI, CSII, and CSIII.
      <ul class="Circle"><br/>
        <li class="Content_body"><strong>Change Specialist I (CSI)</strong> - the person driving the change process in a company. The CSI determines who is technically responsible for problem verification, which changes have higher priority than others, whether an Engineering Change Request (ECR) can be approved through a fast track or if it needs the involvement of a review board. The CSI is also responsible for determining if the required change has wide impact. If it does the CSI can bring others into the review process.</li>
        <br/>
        <li class="Content_body"><strong>Change Specialist II (CSII)</strong> - the person who completes the change process in a company. The CSII decides when approved changes get implemented, when actual items get changed, and if any requests can be combined into a single change notice.</li>
        <br/>
        <li><strong>Change Specialist III (CSIII) - </strong>the person who implements the change in the production process of an affected item. The CSIII decides when the change goes into production and how it affects the existing production flow. By default, the CSIII is only active in a Change Management Workflow during the last phases of an<br/>
          ECN.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <ol class="RoundSquare"><br/>
    <li><strong>Component Engineering</strong> - the people responsible for managing the Parts that a company uses as well as the sourcing aspects of these Parts: Manufacturers, Vendors, and the Lifecycles associated with those items.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>Change Review Board (CRB)</strong> - the people responsible for several steps in the ECR process. When an ECR has wide or complex implications, the CRB is engaged to review the change and provide input into the process.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>All Employees</strong> - the company&#39;s employees.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>All Customers </strong>- the company&#39;s customers. This is relevant if the customers file Problem Reports (PRs).</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>All Suppliers</strong> - the suppliers used by a company.</li>
  </ol>
