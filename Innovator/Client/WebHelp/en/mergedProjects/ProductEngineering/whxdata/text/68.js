rh._.exports({"0":["Configuring Effectivity Management"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Effectivity Management of part BOM structures is available in the Product Engineering (PE) application. This enables expressing Effectivity conditions of Parts within the BOM and resolving BOM structures against these conditions. As an Administrator, you can configure and customize some aspects of Effectivity Management in the PE application, such as:","\n  ","\n    ","Creating additional Effectivity Variables and Effectivity Scopes.","\n    ","Customizing the Effectivity Scope Builder method for custom business logic.","\n    ","Configuring Query Definitions for structure resolution logic.","\n    ","Configuring Tree Grid views to display item and relationship properties.","\n    ","Configuring permissions that determine Effectivity information.","\n  ","\n  ","The effs_name prefix is used for the ItemTypes that belong to Effectivity Managment.","\n  ","\n  ","This section provides a high-level overview of the Effectivity Services-based data model concept as implemented in PE. For more information, refer to the ","Aras Innovator 12.0 - Effectivity Services Programmer's Guide",".","\n  ","An Effectivity Scope defines a context for resolution using Effectivity criteria, which should be applied to particular effective items. An Effectivity Scope consists of the following items:","\n  ","\n    ","Effectivity Variables, which are variables that influence Effectivity decisions.","\n    ","Effectivity Scope ItemType, which determines items to be resolved by Effectivity.","\n  ","\n  ","A Builder Method uses Effectivity Variables to construct a Scope object in the runtime, used by the Effectivity Resolution Engine to perform Resolution of effective items.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Users interact with the Tree Grid View (TGV) to provide the Effectivity Criteria for structure resolution. TGV requests the necessary data from the associated Query Definition (QD). The Effectivity Criteria is passed to the Query Definition via Query Definition parameters.","\n  ","The Query Definition requests Effectivity expression items with the provided Effectivity criteria. The Effectivity Resolution engine resolves Effectivity Expression items against the provided Effectivity Criteria and then returns the result. The results are displayed in a Tree Grid view.","\n  ","\n  ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Configuring Effectivity Management"],"3":["Effectivity Services Data Model Overview","Effectivity Services, TGV, and QD Transactions Overview"," "],"id":"68"})
