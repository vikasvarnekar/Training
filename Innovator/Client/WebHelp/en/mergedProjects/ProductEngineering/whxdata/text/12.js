rh._.exports({"0":["Substitutes"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The substitutes tab for a ","BOM"," "," relationship lists parts that could be used instead of the child part in the making of the parent part. So, for example, if the parent part is an F41 Turbine, and the child part is a 12 Casing Assembly, perhaps a 112 Casing Assembly or a 122 Casing Assembly could be used instead of the 12 Casing Assembly to make the F41 Turbine. However, if the 12 Casing Assembly was also used to make a different turbine, say, F44 Turbine, this substitution would not be allowed there. So, to summarize, the parts listed in the Substitutes table of the BOM relationship define substitutes to be used for the child part in the assembly of its parent part only; this is not a global substitution.
