For example, a paint store may sell red paint from different paint companies.

Then, it is up to the Component Engineering group, or perhaps even a sourcing group, to approve the particular vendor. Vendors are approved based on company specific criteria, such as delivery time agreements, or volume discounts. A Preferred state is granted to a vendor that qualifies for an even higher set of criteria. An Inactive state is reserved for vendors that no longer qualify for approval, even if they were approved in the past.","\n  ","To create Vendors:","\n  ","\n    ","From the Navigation pane, click ","Sourcing>Vendors",".
