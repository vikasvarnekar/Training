rh._.exports({"0":["Class Specific Properties"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Both Part and Document types have initial classification structures. In this application, the normal Aras Innovator classification display has been altered.  Normally, a Parameters tab displays all the class-specific properties in an Item’s form.  The Parameter tab has been disabled.  Instead, these class-specific properties are dynamically displayed on the Item form.","\n  ","Parts class structure can be changed and  expanded to reflect customer needs. Currently, the class Part has four subclasses - Component, Assembly, Material, and Software. You can add subclasses, change them, add a new level of subclasses, and more importantly, add class specific properties that would apply only to the specified class; including a lifecycle.  Here are a few examples.","\n  ","Let's say that for parts classified as software, you want to add a property called Build Number. Here is what you would do.","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","Click the Nav button ",". The TOC appears.","\n    ","\n    ","Click ","Administration>ItemTypes",".
