rh._.exports({"0":["The ECR"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","An ECR is usually either a response to some PRs or a result of proactive thinking used to identify a problem. An ECR is filed to request a change to parts or documents where a problem occurs, or will occur if no action is taken. Of course an ECR filed to prevent problems and improve the product is better than an ECR filed to correct an already existent problem - it allows more time for solution design and a thorough approach that would take into account all ramifications of the proposed change. Sometimes an ECR is filed to correct a very localized problem, that does not have far reaching consequences, and so it may be pushed through the system quickly using the Fast Track approach. Let's take a look at the workflow map of an ECR.","\n  ","\n  ","The ECR workflow begins with the ","Submit ECR"," activity. The creator of an ECR must  vote to Submit the ECR, designating that the ECR is ready for review. The ECR then enters the ","Review ECR"," activity, assigned to the CSI. The CSI reviews all the information entered by the creator of the ECR, and decides to either reject the ECR, or to submit it for technical review. If the CSI decides to reject the ECR, it goes back to the creator, who can review the rejected ECR with comments from the CSI, and then either resubmit or cancel the ECR. If the CSI decides to proceed with the ECR to technical review, he will then assign an Owner to the ECR. The Owner is the person responsible for the technical review, someone who can identify and verify not only the problem itself, but who has a wide enough view to see the ramifications of the problem (and the solution). The Owner receives the ECR when it enters the ","Technical Review"," activity. The Owner conducts the technical review and provides data, comments, and recommendations. He then sends the ECR to its next activity - ","Route ECR",". Here the CSI again picks it up, and he has to make a decision - is it a fast track ECR, or does it need the full Change Review Board (CRB) involvement? Different companies have different criteria for making this decision. Usually, this decision depends on the cost estimates, the timing, and the nature of the problem itself. However, the CSI does have the authority to make this decision. He can either vote CRB Approve or Fast Track Approve. Let's look at the Fast Track Approve first. If voted to fast track, the ECR enters the next activity, ","Disposition ECR"," for which the Owner is again responsible. At this point, the Owner makes the decision to approve or disapprove the ECR. He can also send the ECR back for more investigation. That completes the fast track approve. If the CSI votes CRB Approve, back at the ","Route ECR"," activity, then the ECR enters the ","Prepare CRB"," activity. The CSI is responsible for deciding whether a CRB meeting is necessary, or if an online CRB meeting will suffice. The CSI also prepares all the necessary information to present to the CRB. Either way, whether online or in person, the CRB selects one of the following choices - to require more information, to approve the ECR, or to disapprove the ECR.","\n  "," ","\n  ","Here is a table of all the life cycle states, workflow activities, and permissions for each.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","The final states of the ECR - ","ECR Cancelled",", ","ECR Approved",", and ","ECR Disapproved"," are used by the CSI to keep track of all the ECRs in the system. Just like with the PRs, there are two types of reports available for viewing the ECRs - the ECR Log Report, and the ECR Report. The ECR Log Report displays a table of all ECRs in the system, their current state, who is responsible for them, and which ECNs might contain them. The ECR Report is basically a printable view of the ECR form. These reports are accessible from the ","Reports"," menu choice in the main menu bar.","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["The ECR"],"id":"45"})
