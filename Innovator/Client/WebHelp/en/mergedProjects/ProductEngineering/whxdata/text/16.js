Each company defines the criteria of an alternate part differently. For example, say a car manufacturer produces two different wheel covers. One may be very fancy, and the other may be the basic no frills model. Both wheel covers fit over the same wheel, and from the point of view of mechanics one could very easily replace the other. However, from the marketing point of view, these wheel covers are not interchangeable, and therefore could not be defined as each other's alternate parts.","\n  ","The concept of alternates has global implications. If part1 is an alternate of part2, then part1 could be used instead of part2 in every assembly or every other place where part2 is being used.
