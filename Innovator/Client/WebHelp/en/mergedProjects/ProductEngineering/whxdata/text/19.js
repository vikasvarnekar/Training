The reference designator is a label, assigned to each instance of the resistor. The resistor is further identified by its location on the diagram.","\n  ","Here is an example:","\n  ","To specify instance data, consider a part, such as circuit board JB-11:","\n  ","\n    ","Edit the part, and select the resistor from its ","\n        ","BOM"," ","\n        "," "," table.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n    ","Right click, and select ","BOM>Open"," from the popup menu.
