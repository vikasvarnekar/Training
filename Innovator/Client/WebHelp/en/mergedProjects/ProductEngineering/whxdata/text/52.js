Do not delete or modify the configurations of these Query Definitions unless it is noted otherwise.","\n  ","The following is an overview of the Query Definition configuration for resolving BOM structures against Effectivity criteria. The Query Definitions are out-of-the-box. The following configurations are described:","\n  ","\n    ","Query Definitions that contain Effectivity filtering logic.","\n    ","\n    ","Merging one Query Definition into another Query Definition to create a single executable Query Definition of a related Tree Grid View.","\n  ","\n  ","In PE Part BOM relationships are resolved against effectivity criteria at the BOM Structure accordion tab of a Part item view. The resolution uses Effectivity Scope and Effectivity Variable values set in the Effectivity Criteria Filter dialog. The resolved structure is shown using the PE_BomStructure Tree Grid View (TGV) configuration.","\n  ","\n  ","You can configure the ","PE_BomStructure"," TGV to add, remove, or reorder columns to display Part and Part BOM properties. Adding or removing columns requires changing the Query Definition configuration to return the given properties. Use the standard TGV and QD procedures for this configuration.","\n  ","The Query Definition containing Effectivity filtering logic is ","effs_effectivityResolutionOnPartBom",".
