Managed change allows a company to improve its products and become more successful. Simplified Change Management is a great method for reducing overhead and quickly implementing a released part or document. You can also modify a Parts Approved Manufacturing List (AML) to enhance performance even further.","\n  ","Simplified Change Management uses fewer change items and a simpler approach to affect change on parts and documents. This process is a simpler way to manage change than the default CMII-phased process. Though CMII is still considered to be a best practice, you can use Change Management in parallel.","\n  ","Simplified Change Management uses the following basic ItemTypes:","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","Engineering Change Order (ECO) - Use an Engineering Change Order to make changes to parts and documents. You can also use an ECO to notify users that items have changed. The ECO provides a simple alternative to the CMII process by removing the PR and ECR from the process. There are three types of changes: add, modify, and delete. The ECO is a simple alternative to the CMII process because it removes the PR and ECR from the process. Use the ECO to modify, add or delete parts or documents.","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Manufacturing Change Order (MCO) - Use a Manufacturing Change Order to edit an Approved Manufacturer List (AML) once a part is released. The simplicity of the MCO avoids the need to propagate through the entire ECN process for this type of change.","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Express Document Change Order (DCO) - Use an Express Document Change Order to quickly implement Document and CAD Document changes within an organization.","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  "," ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Introduction"],"id":"44"})
