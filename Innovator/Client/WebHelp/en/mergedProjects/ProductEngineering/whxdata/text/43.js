rh._.exports({"0":["Goals"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Goals can be set based on cost and weight of a Part with calculation of the roll-up value of its child parts. Values may be entered as either target, estimated or actual. These three properties play a crucial role in the goal roll-up for a part. Here is an example of how it works.","\n  ","Let's say a parent part, named Parent, has two child parts - child1 and child2. The child parts have a ","Target"," cost goal, of $10 each. The Parent has a ","Target"," cost goal of $15. You must specify at least a target goal for the parent in order to initiate a roll-up.","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n      ","\n      ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          "," ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Target","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Estimated","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Calculated","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Child1","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","10","\n        ","\n        ","\n          "," ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          "," ","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Child2","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","10","\n        ","\n        ","\n          "," ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          "," ","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Parent","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","15","\n        ","\n        ","\n          "," ","\n        ","\n        ","\n          "," ","\n        ","\n      ","\n    ","\n  ","\n  "," Now, let's say that child1 is about to be bought, and we estimate its cost to be $15.
