After setting the Action field, the Affected Items tab provides guidance for the other fields to be completed. When the ECO is saved, a workflow is automatically started to assign work and track the change. During the Prepare Change activity, the CSI reviews all information and makes decisions about the propagation of the change up a parts assembly line. For example, every company has its own rules dealing with conditions under which a part receives a new revision or maybe an entirely new part number. Also, the parent parts, or the containing assemblies, may require a change of revision or a new part number. The CSI considers all change options to make decisions and recommendations. The CSI also confirms that correct Assigned Creators are assigned for each Affected Item in the ECO. An Assigned Creator is an engineer or technical person responsible for technical implications and ramifications of change to each affected item.","\n    ","The ECO is then promoted and transferred to each individual Assigned Creator during the Draft Changes activity. The Assigned Creator is responsible for updating the BOMs, specifications, drawings, and any other specified documents affected by this change. The affected parts requiring the change of documents is not restricted only to parts being changed directly, but also parent parts or their containing assemblies.","\n    ","The ECO is then transferred to the Initial Review activity and a Change Analyst to review the changes. The Change Analyst can then either Reject, promote to a Full Review, or Fast Track Approve the ECO. If the ECO is rejected it passes back to the Assigned Creators to modify and resubmit to the Change Analyst. Fast Track Approve provides a transition to quickly approve the changes of an ECO and releases it. Releasing the ECO automatically updates the life cycle state of the affected Parts and Documents. A final option is to vote a Full Review. This is an in-depth review process for formal/informal reviews using other team members and then transfers to the CCB Review activity. After the CCB audit is complete the ECO is released, which also automatically updates the life cycle state of the affected Parts and Documents.","\n    ","The following is the Work Flow Map of an ECO:","\n    ","\n    ","Here is a table summary of the workflow activities and life cycle states of the ECO and may choose to reject changes, Review Changes, and CCB Review activities.","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n    "," ","\n  ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["The Express Engineering Change Order (ECO) Process"],"id":"60"})
