rh._.exports({"0":["plm_Engineering Efficiency"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The Engineering Efficiency dashboard consists of two charts. The Standard vs. Fast Track ECRs plot the number of Standard and Fast Track ECRs for each quarter. The favorable trend is to have the Fast Track ECRs increasing, and the Standard ECRs decreasing. The second chart, ECR Cycle Time, shows the number of days it takes an ECR to go through a cycle. These numbers are averaged for each quarter, and plotted alongside the goal. The desirable trend is to have these numbers diminishing over time.","\n  ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Engineering Efficiency"],"id":"40"})
