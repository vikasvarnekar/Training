The first chart tracks the number of ECRs filed as Corrective Action and those filed as Product Improvement for each quarter. Of course the desired trend is to see Corrective Action going down, and Product Improvement going up. The second chart tracks the source of the ECRs, or how many ECRs were initiated internally, by customers, and suppliers for each quarter. If the ECRs initiated by customer complaints is going up, it is probably a good warning sign.","\n  ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Product Innovation"],"id":"42"})
