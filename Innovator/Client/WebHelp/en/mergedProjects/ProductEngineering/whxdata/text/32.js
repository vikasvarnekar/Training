rh._.exports({"0":["Products"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The term “Product” and “Model” can have different relative meanings in different companies and industries.  In Aras Innovator, a product is defined as something that is bought by the customer. For example, for the Ford car company, one of the products could be the Mustang. Each product contains at least one model, which in turn has a one-to-one relationship with a top level assembly Part. In the Ford example, the Mustang model could be a Mustang GT. Sometimes a company will sell not only the actual product model, but also a tool kit, or a repair kit, or some sort of supplement. This can be defined as another model within the same product.","\n  ","Here is how to define a product:","\n  ","\n    "," From the Navigation pane, select ","Design>Products",".
