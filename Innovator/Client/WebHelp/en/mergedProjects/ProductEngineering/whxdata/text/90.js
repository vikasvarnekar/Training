rh._.exports({"0":["structure browser"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Each Aras Innovator ItemType can contain one or more relationship instances. The Structure Browser is used to rapidly view relationship instances in an expandable format. This type of viewing is most useful with part structures such as a Bill of Materials or the viewing of complex relationships between Administration ItemTypes. The examples to follow use a simple Bill of Materials to show the simplicity of the Structure Browser. In general, to view any ItemType in a Structure Browser window, simply Right-Mouse-Click (RMB) an item in the search grid and select “Structure Browser” in the selection list.","\n  ","\n  ","The chosen item displays its ","ItemType – Name – Revision.Generation"," as a single line in a Structure Browser window.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Toolbar icon","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Description","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","Expands all levels of a structure.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","Collapses all levels of a structure.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n        ","Does a comparison with another item of the same type.
