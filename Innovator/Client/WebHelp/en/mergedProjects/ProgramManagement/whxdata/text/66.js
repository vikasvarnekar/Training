The result will look like this.","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n      ","Each Activity has an Assignment, with no work estimate like this:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    "," ","\n    ","\n      ","Now we can create a new Project from the Template and save it, just as we did in Walkthrough 1. This is the result:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Note that  no Lead Role is showing in the ProjectGrid, but if we View/Edit an Activity we can see the assigned Roles copied from the template as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","So we are ready to select our Project Team which consists of Manager, Assemble and Process because these are the roles used in the Assigments. After selecting team members the Team tab looks like this:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","When we save the Project and show the Project Plan it looks as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Note that Leaders are shown in the Grid, each Activity has an assignee, and that assignee is the Leader. (If there were more than one assignee the leader would be selected by matching the Lead Role or manually selected by the Project Manager.) The assigment can be viewed as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","So now with the Project created and scheduled, the Team selected and assignments made, we are ready to promote the project to active and update it to activate the starting Activities. After doing so the Project looks as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","Note that the two starting Activities are active as in Walthrough1. Also, the number of hours are shown in the Hours column in the Project Grid. If we View/Edit an activity we can see the detail as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","For the Sink Activity above, I am assigned in the Manager Role; there is no work estimate because that is our intent in this walkthrough, but we can see th Rollup work estimate is 320 hours,  the expected duration is 40 days, each day is assumed to be 8 hours. 40 X 8 = 320 hours.","\n      ","After ordering our Sink and Cabinets let us go to the InBasket and report our completion. Both Activities are in the InBasket as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","When we update the Sink Activity, the Activity Completion Worksheet appears as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Note that this time the Assignments tab is displayed and it has areas highlighted for the Assignee to report completion. Note also that compared to Walkthrough1, now “rollup” values are shown in the Form, they are not highlighted and cannot be edited. I have shown today as the Actual Start and completion of 2% as before, and click the Save button in the toolbar.","\n      ","After updating the Cabinets Activity in a simlar fashion after updating the Project looks as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Note that the result very similar to Walkthrough 1, however with assignees we can have more than one Assignee per Activity, further Assignees and Leaders can have separate, complementary functions for completing Activities which we’ll go on to illustrate now.","\n      ","For our kitchen project we need the contractor to start in the first week of the new year. Let me add an Activity assigned to me to confirm the contractor will start on schedule. When I have done so it is in my InBasket and the ACW looks as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Here I have set the Actual Start data and checked the Complete box for the Assignment which automatically shows 100% complete. When I click the Save button in the toolbar the Assignment is completed, and since there are no more Assignments to complete the the Activity is also completed and the Activity is removed from my InBasket.","\n      ","If the Project Manager chooses, he can require that after all Assigments are complete the Leader must confirm that Activity is completed. Let’s illustrate that by adding another new Activity to confirm the contractor has the plumber and electrician lined up. Note the new Activity has the Leader Signoff box checked. After saving the Activity looks as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","This time even after repeating steps 17 & 18 the Activity is still in my InBasket as Follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","When I open the ACW it appears as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","Note that my Assigment is complete, but to Complete the Acivity as Leader, I must click the green check mark to complete the Activity also. Having done so the Activity is removed from my InBasket, and after updating the Project it appears as follows:","\n    ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","The other Activities can be completed in a similar fashion.","\n    ","\n  ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"3":["Basic Page"],"4":["Walkthrough 2, Assignee, no Work Estimate, no Time reporting"],"id":"66"})
