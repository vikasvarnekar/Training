When this information is saved in the form, it is automatically updated within the parent project of the activity. So everyone  is always aware of the changes and updates that occur for each of the assigned activities, and how they roll up and affect the status of the project as a whole. Let's take a look at the form itself:","\n","\n\n"," ","\n\n","Notice that this window has several parts: the tool bar icons, the form with Project and Activity sections, and four tabs - Assignments, Deliverables, Comments, and Time Record. The tabs are like those in the ","Activity Detail"," window.

The logged in User can update Actual Start Date and Percent Complete or can mark the Assignment as Complete","Add Deliverable"," - the list of deliverables that are related to this activity. Some activities have required deliverables which must be attached before the activity can be completed. Some activities may have auxiliary deliverables that help the project, but are not required. Here is a view of what this tab looks like:","\n\n\n\n\n","\n\n"," ","\n"," - Add an existing deliverable - displays a search dialog to find and select any item classified as a deliverable. Go to ","Searching Poly Items"," for further information on how to search for a particular deliverable.

Once the new item is created, it is automatically attached to the activity."," - Deletes the selected line item (removes it from the attached list of Deliverables)","Comments"," - the list of comments, along with envelope information for each one. These are also brought in from the Project, the ","Activity/Milestone Comments"," tab of the detail form, which describes in detail the need for comments, as well as how to add them.","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n\n"," ","\n","Time Records"," - the list of records, indicating who worked on the activity and for how long.
