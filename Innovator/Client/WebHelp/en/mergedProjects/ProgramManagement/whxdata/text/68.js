Each role represents a specific type of work to be done, for example there may be work for a manager, a design specialist, a process specialist and a quality specialist. In Aras Innovator PM roles are defined in the List named 'Project Role'. which has the values Manager, Design, Process, Quality and Assemble in the standard Solutions database. It is intended that the List be populated with values according to the customer's needs.","\n    ","\n    ","The Project Role List is used as a property of 'Lead Role' for Activity2 and for the Role property of 'Activity2 Assignment', in this way the Leader of an Activity2 or an the Role of an Assignment can be designated as being for selected role, or left blank.","\n    ","The primary purpose of roles is for use in Project Templates where the type of work is known but the actual assignees are to be determined when a Project is created from the Template.","\n    ","When a Project is created from a Template a list of all the role values used in the Template is made and Project Team relationships created for the Project where the roles are unique. Each Project Team role may have a related alias Identity, representing an individual User.","\n    ","The Project Manager may select people to fulfill each role in the Project Team Tab and when the Project is saved, the selected Team Member will be added as Leader or Assignee wherever that role is used in the Project. This functionality saves the need for the Project Manager to manually assign the same person in multiple places. You can see how this works in ","Walkthroughs",".","\n    ","The Lead Role for Activity2 enables the Project Manager to either:","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Specify a Leader where there are no assignments.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Select which of multiple ","assignees"," should take the lead.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Select someone who is not an assignee as the leader.","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","The role for Activity2 Assignment enables the Project Manager to designate the type of work for an assignment. An Activity2 may have more than one assignment.","\n    ","The Project Team is intended to facilitate the Project Manager's work; it is not intended to be a constraint. When a Project has been created from a Template in the Pending or Active state the Project Manager may need to change the Project Team, Leaders and Assignments.","\n    ","Additional roles may be added to the Project Team, but they are not added automatically if a new Role is added as a Lead Role or Assignment Role.","\n    ","In the standard implementation, when the Project Manager changes a team Member in the Team tab:","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","Any Activities in the Pending state will be changed to the new team Member.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","Any Activities in the Complete state will not be changed, the record will show the member at the time of completion.","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","For any Activities in the Active state where there is an assignee, the Project Manager will need to communicate with the current Assignee and determine whether the current or new Team Member should complete the work in progress. Assignments for Activities in the Active state are not changed automatically unless the assignee is not yet selected. This avoids changes in assignments without consultation, the PM must edit the Assignment to record his decision.","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","The Project Manager may edit any assignment to change the assignee. In the standard implementation, the pick/replace function is disabled where there is both .a role and an assignee. In this case, to select a different assignee the role must first be removed and the pick/replace function will be enabled. Where there is an assignee but no role, and a role is added the assignee will be removed. If it is desired that the Project Manager to substitute different assignees from the Project Team for individual activities without removing the role, that behavior can by a simple customization of the Method named PM_act2Asmnt_OnSelectRow.","\n  ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"3":["Basic Page"],"4":["Project Team"],"5":["Roles"],"id":"68"})
