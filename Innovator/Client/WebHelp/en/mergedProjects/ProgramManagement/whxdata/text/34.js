Templates help to standardize processes, as well as provide a reusable structure for similar projects. Templates can also include best practices and lessons learned from past history. Templates do not include any kind of scheduling or status information.","\n","A Project template may look like this:","\n","\n\n"," ","\n\n","The properties and columns of the template are:","\n","Name"," - A unique project template name","Description"," - the description of the template; this field is not copied into the actual project, so it should be used to describe the particular attributes of this template, helping the Project Manager to identify the appropriate template for a new project.","The ","Project Plan"," tab - the columns of the grid on this tab are:","N"," - the activity or milestone number. Used to identify the activity as a predecessor for another activity. For example, Activity 1 above has an ","N of 1. It is defined as the predecessor of Activity 2.","Project Tree"," - shows the tree element, its place in the tree, and the element's name.","Predecessor"," - a comma separated list of predecessors for this tree element. A predecessor is an activity or a milestone that has to complete before the successor activity can start. In milestone scheduling, each phase must have at least one milestone with no successor, and most likely the rest of the items of the phase as its predecessors. The date of this milestone will be the end date of the phase.","Plan Duration"," - the planned number of working days the activity should take","Plan Hours"," - man hours required to complete the activity. This entry is not related to duration, but is for planning purposes only. The 8/80 rule should be used here - if the activity is less than 8 hours, it probably does not merit its own activity; if activity is more than 80 hours, it should probably be broken down into more manageable pieces.","Attach Required"," - if checked, then a deliverable must be attached for the activity to be complete.","Attach Type"," - from the drop down box, specify the deliverable type; this property is not required to have a value.","Role"," - personnel responsible for this activity; in a template, a precise assignment of a specific identity cannot be made. Therefore, a role is used to designate the personnel responsible. The role list is controlled by the system administrator in ","Roles",".","Required"," - if checked, this is a required activity. The assignee has to specifically check if off on their Activity Completion Form, and perhaps sign off on it, that this particular activity is completed.","The ","Project Plan"," tab - the icons are:","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"," - Add new ","WBS","Work Breakdown Structure"," Element - adds a new WBS element to the tree structure, below the selected tree element."," - Add new activity - adds a new activity to the tree structure, below the selected tree element."," - Add new milestone - adds a new milestone to the tree structure, below the selected tree element."," - View/Edit selected Item - opens the detail dialog for the selected tree element"," - Delete selected Item - deletes the selected (highlighted) tree element"," - Indent item - Indents the selected item, applies only to WBSs."," - Outdent item - Outdents the selected item, applies only to WBSs."," - Cut - Cut the selected item (stores it to a clipboard)"," - Paste - pastes the selection to selected area; available only when the clipboard contains information."," - Expand all - expands all the nodes on the project tree."," - Collapse all - collapses all nodes on the project tree.","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"3":["Basic Page"],"4":["Create a Template"],"6":["Expand TOC"],"id":"34"})
