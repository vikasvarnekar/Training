The Project Manager creates and organizes the structure. Then, the assignees are given the responsibility for specific activities in the project. When the assignees complete these activities, they update their worksheets, which in turn update the Project, allowing the Project Manager to track the progress of the project.  Let's take a closer look at each of these items separately, and then together as they fit into the whole structure.","\n  ","\n    ","WBS","\n    ","Activity2","\n    ","Deliverable","\n    ","Project","\n    ","Activity Completion Worksheet","\n  ","\n  ","The project also has a life cycle associated with it, as shown below:","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","The project has several states, Pending, Active, Cancelled, or Closed.
