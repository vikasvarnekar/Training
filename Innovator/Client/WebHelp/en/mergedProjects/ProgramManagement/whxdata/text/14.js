Because of their differences, however, each one is suited better for a specific type of process. Knowing these differences will allow the user to judge more clearly which type of item should be used to represent a specific process. Let's look at the definitions:","\n  "," ","\n  ","LifeCycle"," - a set of mutually exclusive states that some thing may be in, often representing a stage of a process. For example, all parts or manufactured items have a lifecycle.","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","The specific states may be called: design, review, released, in-change, superseded, and so forth. It is clear how a part that is in the design state, cannot also be in the superseded state. Usually there is a specific flow through these states, which may branch out or feed back in loops.","\n  "," ","\n  ","Workflow"," - a finite set of activities necessary to carry out a process. For example, a workflow for a PR (problem report) might look like this:","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","In the above diagram, specific activities are shown for each PR that may enter the system. These activities must be performed in the order specified. Each activity might further contain lists of action items for the responsible personnel assigned to the activity.","\n  ","Project"," - A progressively elaborated series of steps and actions to achieve a unique result. A project manages the issues of scope, time, and cost to achieve this result.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"3":["Basic Page"],"4":["Definitions"],"id":"14"})
