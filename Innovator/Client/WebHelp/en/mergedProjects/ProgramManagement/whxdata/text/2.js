Here is a list of steps to make this process easier.","\n","Create identities for the top level department headings, for example: Engineering, Sales, and Marketing.","For each top level heading, create subordinate departments. For example, Engineering might have: Development, Support, and QA. Support, in turn, might further consist of: Customer Support, Documentation, and Training. Make sure you add the subordinate departments as members to their respective group identities.","Once the departmental structure is in place, create individual users and add their identities to their respective departments. In Innovator, one user identity can belong to more than one group.","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","There are two basic Identities used in Program Management - Project Management and Quality Engineering. Once the user identities are set up as shown above, they can be added to the Program Management and Quality Engineering Identities. Add the highest level department possible to avoid repetition and promote ease of maintenance.","\n","When creating Identities, we suggest you use the description field to label each identity with a role label. In ","Roles"," we talked about how the templates will use roles as opposed to identities to designate the responsible personnel. When creating a project from the template, the actual identities have to be substituted for the roles. If the identities have a description that corresponds to their role, the searching for the appropriate personnel will be much easier. Here is an example of a search dialog, where the user is searching for all identities whose description corresponds to the \"Design\" role.","\n","\n\n"," ","\n\n\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"3":["Basic Page"],"4":["Setting Up Identities"],"id":"2"})
