<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Flexible Working</h1>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">The policy and procedures relating to Flexible Working do not form part of your terms and conditions of employment.</p>
<p>The company’s Flexible Working Policy outlines the company’s commitment to consider flexible working arrangements for employees to meet their childcare or adult care needs.</p>
<p>The company recognizes the contribution of all its employees and also understands that at some time in their working lives, employees may find it difficult to fulfil domestic, family and working commitments due to having a young family, adopting, having a disabled child or caring for an adult. Where this occurs, the company will always consider practical help through this flexible working policy.</p>
<p>No employee will be treated less favorably, suffer detriment or be dismissed because they request, or take, flexible working.</p>
<p>Flexible working is about considering the way work is organized to see whether it is possible to have different arrangements. The result must always be, however, that the company achieves its core business purpose as efficiently as is possible.</p>
<p>Employees should also be aware that if they request and are given agreed flexible working conditions this is a variation of their terms and conditions of employment and is a permanent change. If their circumstances change in relation to the need for flexible working there is no statutory right for a return to their terms and conditions as they were prior to the flexible working.</p>
<p>The company:</p>

<p class="ListSpacing" style="text-indent: -20px; margin-left: 30px;">Will reject an application where it is considered that on the grounds of business it cannot allow the flexible working as it will be detrimental to the company achieving its business</p>
