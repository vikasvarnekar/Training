<h1><span data-keyref="CoName">Whirl the World</span> - Attendance</h1>
<p>The company wishes to support staff who are unable to fulfil the terms of their employment contract regarding attendance at work for reasons beyond their control. However, the Company expects this support to be reciprocated by all employees so that they comply with their conditions of employment.</p>
<p>This policy is intended to alert and assist managers to reduce the incidence of absence. It is essential that managers have specific responsibility for attendance of their staff and that their staff understand that the policy will be enforced.</p>
<p>Requests for all types of absence must be made to and approved by the employee&#39;s manager.</p>
<h2>Types of absence</h2>
<p>Absence from work occurs for a variety of reasons, but the most common are:</p>

<p class="EmphasisSlate">This procedure is concerned with unauthorized absences that have NOT been approved by an employee’s manager.</p>
<p>To be eligible for sick pay, an employee must comply with the procedures for the notification and certification of absence set out below. Full details of the benefits available can be found in <a href="Company_Sick_Pay.htm">Company Sick Pay Policy</a>.</p>

<h2>Procedure for dealing with poor attendance</h2>
<p>The company has control procedures to monitor unacceptable levels of absence because of their adverse impact on the Company&#39;s business objectives. In determining what constitutes an excessive level of absence and therefore whether to commence disciplinary action, the following will be taken into account:</p>
<?rh-list_start class="RoundSquare" level="1" style="list-style: rh-list; 
                                 list-style: rh-list;" ?>

<p class="ListSpacing" style="text-indent: -20px; margin-left: 30px;">Any apparent pattern</p>
<?rh-list_end ?><?rh-list_start class="RoundSquare" level="1" style="list-style: rh-list;

<?rh-list_end ?>
<p class="EmphasisSlate">Managers must identify employees with poor attendance records and discuss these with them. Human Resources must be advised of this action.  The employee must be informed of the facts and records of unauthorized absence and warned that if there is no improvement in attendance, the Company’s Disciplinary Procedures may be initiated.</p>
