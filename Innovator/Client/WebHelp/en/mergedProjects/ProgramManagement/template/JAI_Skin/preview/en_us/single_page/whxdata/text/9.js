Employees should also note that the imposition of a condition or requirement which has an adverse impact on someone, because his or her sex, race or marital status is more likely to be affected by it, will be unlawful unless it can be justified on grounds of business need. By way of example, a height requirement of 5’ 10” will eliminate some men but proportionately more women and so be unlawful. In all such situations Human Resources should be consulted.","\n","\n","Include in all advertisements a statement on Equal Opportunities and where necessary encourage applications from under-represented groups for jobs with the company.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Selection","\n","\n","\n","The aim of the company is to select employees on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.","\n","In order to achieve this:","\n","\n","The suitability of each applicant/candidate will be measured against the requirements for the job.","\n","\n","The use of selection tests will be regularly examined to ensure that they are related to job requirements and are not unlawfully discriminatory.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Promotion","\n","\n","\n","The aim of the company is to promote employees on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.","\n","In order to achieve this:","\n","\n","The promotion criteria will relate specifically to the individual’s ability and aptitude to do the job.","\n","\n","The company will periodically review the promotion procedure.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Transfer","\n","\n","\n","The aim of the company is to (where necessary) transfer employees on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.","\n","In order to achieve this:","\n","\n","The company will not automatically transfer employees who complain of discrimination.","\n","\n","The company will periodically review its criteria for transferring employees.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Training","\n","\n","\n","All persons responsible for recruitment, selection, promotion and transfer of staff will receive training in equal opportunities.","\n","Training will achieve two objectives:","\n","\n","Enable employees to recognise the company’s and their own legal obligations under legislation.","\n","\n","Develop the necessary skills to translate the equal opportunities in employment policy into practice.","\n","\n","The company will also ensure that all its employees have equal access to training and development opportunities.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Dismissal (including redundancy) and other detriment","\n","\n","\n","The aim of the company is to ensure that it does not unlawfully or unfairly discriminate in dismissal, redundancy or other detriment to an employee.","\n","In order to achieve this the company will continually examine its procedure and criteria to ensure that they do not directly or indirectly discriminate against a particular group or groups.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Discipline","\n","\n","\n","Any employee who harasses any other employee on the grounds of race, sex or disability will be subject to the organization's disciplinary procedure.  In serious cases, such behavior will be deemed to constitute gross misconduct and, as such, will result in summary dismissal in the absence of mitigating circumstances.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Monitoring and positive action","\n","\n","\n","The composition of the workforce and of job applicants will be monitored on a regular basis.
