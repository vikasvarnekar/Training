The procedures apply to all employees. The aim is to ensure consistent and fair treatment for all in the company.","\n","\n","\n","Informal action will be considered, where appropriate, to resolve problems.","\n","\n","No disciplinary action will be taken against an employee until the case has been investigated.","\n","\n","For formal action the employee will be advised of the nature of the complaint against him or her and will be given the opportunity to state his or her case before any decision is made at a disciplinary meeting.","\n","\n","Employees will be provided, where appropriate, with written copies of evidence and relevant witness statements in advance of a disciplinary meeting.

A union official means a full-time official or a lay official certified by the union as having experience of, or having been trained in, acting as a companion at disciplinary hearings. It should be noted that neither spouse/partner nor solicitor are suitable companions.","\n","\n","At the disciplinary hearing, the employee will be invited to state his or her case and to answer the allegations against him or her.

Employees should be advised of the reason for the warning, that it constitutes the first stage of the disciplinary procedure and of their right of appeal. This warning will be recorded and retained in the employee’s file and will remain active for disciplinary purposes for six months.","\n","\n","In the case of a more serious offence or if a further offence occurs within the currency of a prior warning, the employee may be given a formal written warning or, where the offence is sufficiently serious, a final written warning. The written warning will state:","\n","\n","Details of the misconduct or complaint that has occasioned the warning","\n","\n","Details of the action necessary to remedy the situation and any period of review","\n","\n","The period of time the warning will remain active on the employee’s file for disciplinary purposes","\n","\n","That the employee has the right to appeal against the warning","\n","\n","That any further misconduct of any kind will result in:","\n","\n","Dismissal with appropriate notice in the case of a final written warning, or","\n","\n","A further disciplinary hearing and a final written warning which, if unheeded, may result in dismissal with notice.","\n","\n","Alternative disciplinary actions short of dismissal may be considered.
