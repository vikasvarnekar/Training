rh._.exports({"0":["Class Structure"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Each ItemType can contain a class structure that contains many levels of subclasses. Each subclass can have its own class specific properties and forms.  Each subclass inherits its parents class properties, and also may have its own. For these examples, we will be working with an ItemType called Geometric Shape. Let's first examine how to create a class structure.","\n  ","Creating a class structure:","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","In the Navigation pane, select ","Administration>ItemTypes",".

Remember, each subclass inherits all the properties of all its parent classes. For example, all we need to define a square is the length of one side. However, to define a rectangle you need the lengths of two sides. The rectangle will already inherit one property of a side length, so all you need to define for the rectangle is another side.  Let's look at how to define properties and how they are inherited.","\n  ","Creating class specific properties:","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","On the ItemType form, select the ","Properties ","tab, and click the ","Search ","button "," for all not Hidden properties (put a 0 in the Hidden search column).","\n    ","Click the ","New Property"," button  "," on the Properties tab to add the following properties, paying special attention to the Class Path column.  When you click inside the Class Path column cell, a dialog box containing the class structure appears.  Select the class to which the property belongs and click the green checkmark ",":","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","Color"," - add to the GeometricShape parent class\n      ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","Radius","- add to the Circle subclass\n      ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","Side Length","- add to the Square subclass\n      ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","Side 2 Length - add to the Rectangle subclass","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","              Make sure you have the TOC Access, Permissions, and Can Add set as desired.
