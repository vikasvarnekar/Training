The Collect Data activity has been selected.  Notice that out of  tasks, only one is required.  Below is a list of properties that describe a task.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Sequence - The order number of the task. Determines the order in which tasks appear on the Completion Worksheet.","\n  ","Required - if true, this task will require the assignee's sign-off when completed in order for the activity to be considered complete.","\n  ","Description - the description of the task to be completed by the assignee.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The next tab for the Activity is ","Notifications",".  Notification allows email messages to be configured to be sent automatically from chosen identities to chosen identities. Notifications are triggered by the selected events, such as On Active (when the activity becomes active), or On Delegate (when the activity is delegated). Notifications can also contain current instance data, such as the values of any specified properties of the ItemType instance with which this workflow is associated, or the properties of the workflow process itself. You can also include any other instance data, from other items, such as properties of a related item, or the name of the activity itself, by providing a query to retreive this information from the database. For more information, see Configring Notifications.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The ","Paths ","tab lists all the exit paths that flow out of the selected activity. This list is filled in automatically when the diagram is completed in the graphical map designer. The following is a view of the paths listed for the Review ECR activity. From this tab you can edit the paths, but you cannot delete them or create new ones. For a full explanation of the properties of the path, see Workflow Paths.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The ","Variables ","tab stores activity variables which can receive data from the assignees, or can be used for internal calculations based on activity properties. See how these variables appear on the Completion Worksheet to be completed by the assignee. The following is a list of properties by which a variable is defined.","\n  ","\n  ","Sequence ","- the sequence number of the variable determines the display order on the Activity Completion Worksheet where the assignee will be entering the value. If the variable is hidden, the sequence number is of no significance.","\n  ","Name ","- the name of the variable.","\n  ","Type ","- the data type of the variable.","\n  ","Source ","- the data source for specific data types of the variable, such as a list or sequence.","\n  ","Default Value ","- If the variable is required, it's a good idea to provide a default value.","\n  ","Required ","- if true, the activity cannot complete without a valid value for the variable.","\n  ","Hidden ","- if true, the variable will not show up on the Activity Completion Worksheet. If the variable is also required, the value must be set by internal code befrore the activity can be completed.","\n  ","Assignments"," is the tab where those responsible for the activity are identified.  Along with specifying the identity responsible for performing the tasks, here we set the options on how the next activity will be reached.  The following is a workflow map where there are two exit paths from the Analyze and Sort activity - Test Data and Reject Data.  Once the tasks of the Analyze and Sort activity are completed, each identity responsible for this activity will have to select the exit path, in this case either Test Data or Reject Data.  The process of selecting the exit path is called \"voting\". See ","Workflow Examples"," to understand how the different options work together.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The columns listed here - ","Required",", ","For All Members",", and ","Voting Weight"," - combined with the ","Wait For All Inputs"," header property determine when the activity will be considered done, and also sets properties of the voting process.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Name"," ","- The identity responsible for the tasks of this activity, and also for voting on the exit workflow path out of this activity.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Required"," ","- When checked it means that members of this identity must complete this activity (finish the tasks and vote on the exit path from the activity), even if there have already been enough votes to determine the next activity.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","For All Members"," ","- this option applies only to group identities assigned to this activity; if false, only one member of the group identity has to complete and vote on the activity, which will then automatically remove this activity from the other group members' In Basket. If true, all members have to complete and vote on the activity and will be assigned equal voting weight with the cumulative weight equal to the assigned voting weight.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Voting Weight"," - In order for a path to be selected it has to reach at least 100% vote, or more.  Please refer to ","Examples"," to see how the voting weight and other options determine the exit path of the activity.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Escalate To"," - an identity that will receive this assignment if the activity is not completed by the due date + time out.  If no identity is specified here, then the Activity Escalate To identity will receive this assignment.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Server Events"," ","is the last tab and it contains the methods that can be executed when triggered on the specified list of Server Events.  The trigger events are: On Activate, On Assign, On Refuse, On Delegate, On Vote, On Remind, On Due, On Escalate, and On Close.  The instruction on writing methods is beyond the scope of this manual.
