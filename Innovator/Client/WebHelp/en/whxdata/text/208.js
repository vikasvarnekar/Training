rh._.exports({"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n    ","\n    ","Aras Innovator provides the ability to track the history of an item and record the changes that have been made since its creation.  Aras Innovator includes a set of ","Actions"," that can be used to determine which events are captured within the history logs.  History can be tracked at both the Item and Property level.  So, for example, if the name property of an item was modified by a user, the system can track not only that the item was modified, but that the name property was changed and what the old vs. new values were.  Also, History tracking takes advantage of the built-in Aras Innovator multilingual capabilities such that history log labels and comments are recorded in multiple languages simultaneously (","refer to the section on internationalization for more information on configuring Aras Innovator to handle multiple languages",").","\n    ","It is important to note that history is ","not"," enabled by default and must be configured for each ItemType that is to have history tracked.  This prevents the database from being taxed by unnecessary data.  Also, if an existing ItemType has history enabled ","after"," item instance data already exists in the database, history will be logged for each item instance only for future point events.   Similarly, if an existing ItemType has history disabled ","after"," item instance data already exists in the database, then future changes will no longer track historical events.  However, any history recorded for those item instances ","before"," it was disabled will remain in the database and viewable by users.","\n    ","\n    ","Only specific actions will trigger a history record to be written by the system.  These actions are:","\n    ","\n      ","\n
