Notice that the Related Item property columns appear on the Right, after the Relationship property columns. Also, notice that the list of parts is sorted on the Quantity, which is the relationship's ItemType property whose Order By setting has precedence.","\n","\n","Below is a view of the BOM tab of the source or parent part when Grid View is set to Intermix.  Notice that the columns are laid out in the absolute order as indicated by the Sort Order for each property.  The order of the rows is also controlled by the absolute sorting sequence of the Order By attribute.  The rows are sorted first on Part Name which has an Order By value of 10, then Quantity, which has an Order By value of 15, and finally by Part Number, which has an Order By value of 20.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Pick Only","\n","\n","\n","When creating a new related entry in the relationship grid, you could only pick from the existing Related Item instances.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Create Only","\n","\n","\n","When creating a new related entry in the relationship grid, you could only create new instances of the Related Item.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Pick & Create","\n","\n","\n","When creating a new related entry in the relationship grid, you could either pick from the existing Related Item instances, or create new ones to populate the relationship.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Requires Related","\n","\n","\n","When checked, the No Related option is excluded from the drop down box of the source instance. So, when creating a new relationship entry for the source instance, you have only two choices: Pick Related or Create Related.  Either way the related item must be entered.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Open Related Form","\n","\n","\n","If true, when creating a new related entry in the relationship grid, and creating a new instance of the Related Item, the form of the Related Item will be opened automatically for edit. If false, you can just enter the data into the property columns, or open the form manually from the popup menu option.  ","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Copy Permissions","\n","\n","\n","This option is relevant only if Create Related is True (","see below","). This case deals with the following occurrence: There is an instance of Part, called Part1 and in its BOM there is an instance of Bracket, called Bracket1. The user copies and pastes Bracket1  to another instance of Part, Part2. On the BOM RelationshipType the Create Related option is set to True; therefore  Bracket1 is copied to a new instance of Bracket, Copy of Bracket1.","\n","\n","If the original instance Bracket1 had private permissions, the user has an option to copy those specific permissions by setting this flag to true:","\n","\n","\n","Copy Permissions = True - The permission on original part (Bracket1) is referenced by the newly created part (Copy of Bracket1)","\n","\n","\n","Copy Permissions = False - The newly created part (Copy of Bracket1) will have the default permissions set on its ItemType definition.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Create Related","\n","\n","\n","This option is relevant only when copying and pasting relationships.  Let's use the example of a Part assembly in whose BOM there is a part called Bracket.  If you copy Bracket and paste it into the BOM of another parent Part, the following options are available:","\n","\n","\n","Create Related = False - The new parent will reference the same Bracket instance as the original Part assembly","\n","\n","\n","Create Related = True - The new parent will reference a newly created Bracket instance,  Copy of Bracket.","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Once the properties are entered, the next step is to enter information into the tabs:","\n","\n","Grid Events"," - If you wish to run client side methods, triggered on grid events such as: OnSelectRow, OnInsertRow, and OnDeleteRow, you would put your methods here.  You might want to consider these methods if say you wish to populate some data into a relationship automatically when it is first created (OnInsertRow).  For a great explanation on how to write client side method and how to set the other properties of this tab, such as RunAs User, please refer to the Aras Advanced Programming Training.","\n","\n","\n","\n"," ","\n","\n","Relationship View"," - Sometimes you may not wish to see the basic relationship grid when you click the relationship tab in the source or parent instance. You may perhaps wish to see a web page, or a configurable grid . This tab is the place where you would specify these settings.  Also, these settings are identity based, so different users could be directed to different pages or grids. Here is an example of using a configurable grid instead of the basic relationship grid:","\n","\n","\n","\n"," ","\n","\n","Let's examine the properties or columns of this tab:","\n","\n","Name"," - the name of the identity for which this view is valid","\n","\n","Start Page"," - the http:// path to the web page to be displayed","\n","\n","Parameters"," - the inputs (if any) that you wish to pass to the web page","\n","\n","Grid"," - the reference (chosen from a selection dialog) to a configurable grid designed for this view","\n","\n","Exclusion"," - Sometimes relationships may be mutually exclusive.  For example, you may have a relationship such as a BOM for a part, and a relationship such as Vendors for a part.  However, the part is either made in house, in which case you would need a BOM tab, or it is bought from a vendor, in which case you only need a Vendors tab. So, on the Exclusion tab you can specify a list of relationships that are mutually exclusive.  In this example, in the RelationshipType for BOMRel, you would specify VendorsRel under the Exclusion Tab.","\n","\n","Hide In"," - When selected, this option will hide the relationship tab in all Source item instances.  For example, if we edit the BOM relationship, and select Hide In Tab View, the BOM tab will be hidden in all instances.","\n","\n","\n","\n"," ","\n","\n\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Modifying the RelationshipType Item"],"id":"191"})
