Examples of a Single Item type include definitions of Part, Document, Project, DFMEA, etc.","\n  ","\n  ","A Poly Item implementation type represents a  polymorphic class of ItemType.  A Poly Item ItemType can represent a collection of other ItemTypes.  A polymorphic (Poly Item) ItemType is typically used when a  property of some other item can reference more than one possible type of Item - a project Deliverable, for example.  The type of deliverable can be one of many possible types if Item. The deliverable may be a Document, a Part, a Control plan, etc.","\n  ","The Poly Item type has a somewhat limited set of compatible relationships that are applicable in the ItemType definition.  Only those Tabs that remain active in the ItemType form are supported in a Poly Item type.","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Implementation Types"],"3":["Single Item","Poly Item"],"id":"78"})
