Classification allows you to share properties among subclasses. If you define a property at a parent level class, all subclasses inherit those properties. Each of these subclasses can have additional specific properties in addition to the properties defined by the parent ItemType. A class structure can be many levels deep and wide depending on the complexity required.","\n","For example, in the CAD Form, click "," to view the class structure for CAD Item Type.","\n","The classification dialog box is displayed.","\n","\n","\n"," ","\n","\n","In the example, the CAD ItemType has a defined class structure.  A CAD can be represented as Mechanical or Electronic.  Because each of the subclasses share common attributes it can be more efficient to use class structure versus creating entirely new ItemTypes.  ","\n","Selecting an Item","\n","\n","In the Form, click ",".","\n","\n","The Search dialog is displayed.","\n","\n","Specify the search criteria and click ",".","\n","\n","The search grid displays list of Items that match the search criteria.","\n","\n","Select the Item from the grid and click ",".","\n","\n\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["Form Field Types"],"id":"233"})
