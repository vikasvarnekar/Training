instantiated from the workflow map, the team identity or role assignments will be converted into individual assignments for each member of the team or role.","  ","For example, if the Team identity is specified as an assignment on a workflow map activity for a particular item, then the resulting workflow process created from the workflow map will have individual assignments for each member of the team.","  ","Different rules apply based on the assignment attributes defined in the workflow map (see examples, below).","  ","Similarly, if a Team Role (i.e. Team Manager) is specified as an assignment for a workflow map activity for a particular item, then the resulting workflow process created from the workflow map will have individual assignments for each member on the team with that
