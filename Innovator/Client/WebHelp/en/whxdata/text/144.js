rh._.exports({"0":["About Vaults"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","The Innovator architecture includes support for vaults which provide secure storage of files.  Innovator uses its database to manage the metadata about the files stored in the vaults.  The vault does not have its own database or login.  Physical files\n    such as documents, drawings, or CAD objects are managed in one or more separate file vaults that are configured in the Innovator administrator interface. The architecture allows for independent vault servers separate from the Innovator application\n    server.  Each vault server must have all of the code required to run in its own directory tree.","\n\n","\n  ","\n    "," ","\n    ","©2020 Aras Corporation - All Rights Reserved","\n  ","\n\n"],"2":["About Vaults"],"id":"144"})
