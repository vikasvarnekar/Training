rh._.exports({"0":["Configuring Notifications"],"1":["\n  ","\n  ","\n  ","Notification allows e-mail messages to be configured to be sent automatically from chosen identities to chosen identities.  Notifications are triggered by selected events, such as On Activate (when the activity becomes active), or On Delegate (when the activity is delegated).  Notifications can also contain current instance data, such as the values of any specified properties of the ItemType instance with which this workflow is associated.  You can also include any other instance data, from other items, such as some properties of a related item, or the name of the activity itself, by providing a query to retrieve this information from the database.  Here is an example of the Notification tab for an activity.","\n  ","\n  ","\n  "," ","\n  ","\n  ","The following is a list of all properties of the notification configuration and their descriptions:","\n  ","\n    ","\n      ","\n      ","\n    ","\n    ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Property","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Description","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Name","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","The name of the notification itself.  These can be reused, so the name should be a good identifier to describe what information this e-mail provides.","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","From User","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","The Identity from whose e-mail address the notification is sent.  Click F2 in the cell to bring up a search dialog of identities.  The chosen Identity must have a valid e-mail address.","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Subject","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","The subject line of the e-mail.  The subject, just like the body of the e-mail can use variables in its text.  See ","Using Variables"," for more information.","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Body Plain","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","Plain text version of the message to be sent (for recipients who do not accept HTML).  The  body of the e-mail can use variables in its text.  See ","Using Variables"," for more information.","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Body HTML","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","HTML version of the message to be sent.  The  body of the e-mail can use variables in its text.  See ","Using Variables"," for more information.","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Query String","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","If you wish to write complex notifications, that require data from various items in Innovator, you can write a query to request this data from the database.  The retrieved data can then be referenced in the body of the e-mail message.  For example, if you wish to show values of a related item in the e-mail message, you will need to write a query to retrieve it.  To learn how to write these queries, please refer to the Advanced Programming course, or contact your Aras Consultant.","\n        ","\n      ","\n      ","\n        ","\n          ","Event","\n        ","\n        ","\n          ","The e-mail message is automatically sent on the selected event.
