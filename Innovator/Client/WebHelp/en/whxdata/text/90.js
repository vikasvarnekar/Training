For example, if E-signature is specified,\n                      then the Worksheet will be displayed as follows:","\n                    ","\n                    ","\n                      ","\n                      ","\n                        "," If no authentication was specified, both the Password and the E-signature fields would be grayed out.  If authentication is requested and none is provided by the assignee, an error is posted, and the activity is not completed.","\n                        ","\n                          ","Default Path"," - a Boolean flag to denote a default path, which is followed if no other path has enough votes to be activated.
