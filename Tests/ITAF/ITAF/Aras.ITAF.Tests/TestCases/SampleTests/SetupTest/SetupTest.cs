	/// <summary>
	/// This class contains sample tests that demonstrate how to use 'Setup Test.xml'.
	/// The 'Setup Test.xml' executes some setup actions before a run of the first test in a Category.
	/// Usually the 'Setup Test.xml' prepares metadata for test cases, but 
	/// After all tests in a Category finished - TestCaseCleanUp section it the 'Setup Test.xml' is called.
	/// 
	/// NOTE: keep in mind that relative path to the 'Setup Test.xml' evaluated based on a type's full name ([namespace].[type_name]; e.g. 'Aras.ITAF.Tests.SampleTests.SetupTest').
	/// Prerequisites to use the 'Setup Test.xml':
	/// 1) A name of a class, marked with [TestFixture] attribute, should be the same as a name of a folder, that contains 'Setup Test.xml' file
	/// 2) A namespace should reflect relative path from the 'TestsCases' directory to a parent directory from step 1, separated by dots]
	///    Example: Aras.ITAF.Tests.SampleTests
	///    'Aras.ITAF.Tests' replaced by 'TestCases', dots replaced by slashes, class name and the 'Setup Test.xml' file name added to end. Result path is:
	///    TestCases\SampleTests\SetupTest\Setup Test.xml.
